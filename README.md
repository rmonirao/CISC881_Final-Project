Lung Nodule Classification in Low-Dose CT Scans Katya Dunets and Monica Rao

In this study, we propose a 3D-CNN model that optimizes false-positive reduction of lung-nodule detection in LDCT scans in computer-aided diag-nostics systems (CAD). Given a set of candidate locations, our model as-signs each location a classification of being a nodule or non-nodule, achiev-ing an accuracy of 83%, and high specificity of 95%. The incorporation of a false-positive reduction model in CAD systems may aid in optimizing the process of CAD systems and reduce the burden of manual interpretation of such scans for radiologists.
